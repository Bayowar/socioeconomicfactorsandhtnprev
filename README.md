# The Impact of Structural Socioeconomic Factors on Hypertension Prevalence in the U.S.: A Case Study of Washington, D.C. Using ARDL and Spatial Metrics'

Hypertension remains a major public health challenge in the United States, particularly in urban areas where socioeconomic inequalities persist. This study investigates how selected social determinants—poverty, unemployment, lack of health insurance, and an aging population—impact hypertension prevalence in the District of Columbia. Using annual data from 2014 to 2024, the study employs time series econometric techniques to assess both short-run and long-run relationships among the variables. Findings reveal that poverty and unemployment are significantly associated with increases in hypertension-related deaths, while lack of health insurance and elderly population share show weaker effects. The study indicates the need for targeted health policies that address the broader social and economic conditions influencing hypertension outcomes in vulnerable communities.
